Efficient data retrieval and presentation are crucial aspects of application development. GORM, the robust Go Object-Relational Mapping library, equips developers with powerful tools to achieve this. In this guide, we'll delve into the world of pagination and sorting in GORM. By the end, you'll be proficient in implementing these features to streamline data presentation and enhance user experience in your Go projects.

## Implementing Pagination with GORM

Pagination enables you to retrieve and present data in manageable chunks, enhancing performance and usability.

**Step 1: Limit and Offset**

Use GORM's `Limit` and `Offset` methods to implement pagination:

```go
var products []Product
db.Limit(10).Offset(20).Find(&products)
```

**Step 2: Paginating With Page Number**

Implement pagination using page numbers and a fixed number of records per page:

```go
pageNumber := 2
pageSize := 10
var products []Product
db.Limit(pageSize).Offset((pageNumber - 1) * pageSize).Find(&products)
```

Sorting Query Results with GORM

Sorting query results according to specific criteria enhances data presentation and usability.

**Step 1: Sort Query Results**

Use GORM's `Order` method to sort query results:

```go
var sortedProducts []Product
db.Order("price desc").Find(&sortedProducts)
```

Example: Sorting by Multiple Columns with GORM

To sort query results by multiple columns, use a comma-separated list within the `Order` method:

```go
var products []Product
db.Order("category asc, price desc").Find(&products)
```

**Conclusion**

Pagination and sorting are essential techniques for efficient data presentation in your applications. GORM's built-in methods for pagination and sorting provide you with the tools to manage large datasets and tailor their presentation to users' needs. As you apply the insights and examples from this guide, keep in mind that GORM's pagination and sorting capabilities are designed to enhance user experience and optimize data interactions in your Go projects. Whether you're building a dynamic web application or a data-intensive service, mastering pagination and sorting in GORM empowers you to provide a seamless and efficient user experience.
